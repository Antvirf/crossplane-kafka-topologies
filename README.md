# Kafkakewl-like management of 'Kafka Topologies' using Crossplane

Like Kafkakewl, but using Crossplane and its Kafka provider to manage creation of Kafka 'topologies' using Kubernetes CRDs.


## To-do

- Review at all resources KafkaKewl creates, complete todo for resources to manage
  Topics
  ACLs
  ...users? groups? offsets?
- Add management of ACLs, as derived from applications and relationships


## Test setup

```bash
# create cluster with kind

# install crossplane

# follow Kafka provider setup

# apply xrd

# apply composition

# create sample topolgoy

# describe
```
```
```
